        <p>My name is Mica Shenk. I am twenty years old and am a junior at Cedarville University studying graphic and web design. I love the outdoors and get a lot of inspiration from the beautful world around me. This site contains my resume and some portflio pieces that I have made over the past few years. Thanks for visiting! </p>

                    <p> One thing I love about school is that it is an environment that fosters growth, allowing me to explore a lot of different avenues in design. I want to share just a few of the pieces I have done this past year. </p>
