      <h3>2016 | Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop</h3>
      <p>This was a class project in which I collected typography examples to put into an "alphabet book". After developing an initial, overarching concept, I carried it throughout the entirety of the book. I went the route of a coloring book based around what kids see at school. I hand drew all of the doodles, digitized them, and then laid them out to be engaging to an audience of children who want to color when bored at school.</p>
