      <p>This is a depiction of the Bible story of baby Moses who, after being put in the river in a basket by his mother, was miraculously rescued by the Pharoah's daughter. I wanted to communicate the sorrowful surrendering of his own mother, along with the welcoming safety offered by the Pharoah's daughter. I'm symbolizing God's providential guidance through the sunlight carrying Moses.</p>
