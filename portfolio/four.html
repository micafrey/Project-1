      <p>Toccoa Coffee is an Indiana farmer's market coffee shop that I rebranded. After working for them for a summer, I had an inside scoop of the ins and outs of the people and their purpose. The owner's focus was on the relationships that coffee allows people to form. The origin of the name is from the Toccoa River in Georgia, and the peace and wholesome tranquility that he experienced there. These were my two main inspirations and focuses during this rebrand.</p>
