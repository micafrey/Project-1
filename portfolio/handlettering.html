                <h3>grace church cafe</h3>
                <p>Grace Church wanted their café’s wall to be more visually engaging than just a sign that contained the menu, which is what it had been previously. I created their logo identity and the menu design first on Illustrator. I then projected it onto the chalk wall and copied my design with chalk paint. Working in a large space like this was a great experience, and the challenge of encorporating many elements into this large menu wall was a fun additive. </p>
