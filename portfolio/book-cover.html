                <h3>penguin book cover</h3>
                <p>This was a book cover design made for a Penguin Books cover competition. I focused on designing appropriately for my audience of 11-13 year olds, and creating cohesion between the front cover, spine, and back cover. I wanted the color pallete and illustration style to be engaging to my audience and to communicate the concept of the book without giving away too much.</p>
